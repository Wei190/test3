# MSTU 5013 Airacer Design Document

## Topic
I want to create an online marketplace in the General Aviation industry. It is the one-stop shopping site for your overall aviation experience. By seamlessly connecting flight service providers to future pilots, flight enthusiasts and AvGeeks, I want to make flying more accessible. I dedicated to providing a platform where aviation enthusiasts can share their passion with like-minded people. And also the website can help students study fly knowledge online.

## Problem
The current aviation market, there are a variety of large and small different business models, some of which small flight school, not only the flight quality is difficult to guarantee, while the price is also uneven, often cause consumer confusion. After experiencing the flight study, I think that there is an objective and fair platform to integrate all the flight experience activities and publish it on the website, which will make the aviation market more open and transparent. This helps to remove some fake information. Users can write some reviews on flight experience which they participate. New users through the fair rating and evaluation to objectively judge and select the flight products.
At the same time, the system also helped flight schools and individual pilots to provide their business model. They can like Uber drivers, to have their own business. This will help them to use their leisure time, earn more money, but also can reduce the average cost of the entire industry, to bring convenience to customers.
